## Why These Were Archived

These documents contained significant duplication and overlapping content. They have been:

1. **Consolidated** - Similar content merged into authoritative versions
2. **Updated** - Information brought current with latest implementation
3. **Organized** - Structured for better navigation and understanding
4. **Standardized** - Consistent formatting and style across all docs

## Current Documentation Structure

The main docs directory now contains:
- `README.md` - Documentation index and navigation
- `manifesto.md` - Vision, philosophy, and call to action
- `technical-whitepaper.md` - Complete technical specification
- `technical-considerations.md` - ICO readiness and implementation assessment
