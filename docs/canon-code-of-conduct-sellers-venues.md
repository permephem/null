# 🏛️ Canon Code of Conduct for Sellers & Venues

By issuing or selling tickets through Canon, you agree to uphold the following principles:

## 1. Authenticity First

Every ticket issued must be inscribed in the Canon ledger at the moment of creation. No shadow inventories, no off-ledger sales.

## 2. Fair Resale Practices

All secondary transfers must flow through Canon, ensuring caps, limits, and restrictions set by the venue or artist are honored.

## 3. Consumer Protection

If a ticket is revoked due to unauthorized resale or fraud, the fan will always be refunded or re-seated. Venues and sellers commit to shielding fans from financial harm.

## 4. Transparency of Supply

Venues must disclose the number of tickets allocated to the public vs. partners/promoters. Canon makes this transparent without revealing sensitive business details.

## 5. Accountability for Misuse

Resellers or issuers found exploiting the system — whether through bypassing Canon or issuing non-canonical tickets — will be blacklisted from the Canon registry.

## 6. Shared Stewardship

A portion of fees collected flows into the Consumer Protection Pool and Canon Foundation. This ensures long-term sustainability and fairness across all markets.

## 📜 Our Commitment

Sellers and venues pledge to honor fans' rights. Canon ensures fans and artists both win — while bad actors are locked out.
