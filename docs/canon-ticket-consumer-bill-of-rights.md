# 🎟️ Canon Ticket Consumer Bill of Rights

Buying a ticket should never feel like a gamble. With Canon-verified tickets, every fan is protected by design.

## 1. Right to a Real Ticket

Every ticket you buy through Canon is cryptographically verified at the source. No duplicates, no counterfeits, no scams.

## 2. Right to a Fair Transfer

Funds are held in escrow until your ticket is securely inscribed in the Canon ledger. If a transfer fails, your money is returned — automatically.

## 3. Right to Be Made Whole

If a ticket you purchased in good faith is ever revoked, you will be refunded in full or provided with a replacement ticket of equal value. Fans are never punished for fraud — bad actors are.

## 4. Right to Transparency

Every ticket's journey is publicly recorded in the Canon ledger: when it was issued, transferred, or revoked. Nothing is hidden.

## 5. Right to Protection from Predatory Resellers

Resellers caught breaking rules are blacklisted from the Canon. Fans remain protected — resellers bear the risk, not buyers.

## 6. Right to Assurance

A small fee on every sale funds a Consumer Protection Pool, ensuring fans are covered in every scenario. Think of it as built-in ticket insurance — no opt-in required.

## 📜 Our Promise

With Canon tickets, you will never lose your money because of fraud, resales, or revocations. Fans come first. Always.
